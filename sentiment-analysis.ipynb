of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode youll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with methe first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the wordit is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far awayi would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz doesnt mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldnt say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side'\n 'a wonderful little production the filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimebbc fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done'\n 'i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to lovethis was the most id laughed at one of woodys comedies in years dare i say a decade while ive never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young womanthis may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends'\n ...\n 'i am a catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns taught by jesuit priests in high school  college i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a good catholic in the churchs eyes because i dont believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me toso back to the movieits bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be goodat first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister marys emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedythe tragedy of loss of life besides the two former studentsthe lives of the aborted babies the life of the students mom the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god this is what is wrong with todays islam and yesterdays judaism and christianity'\n 'im going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with maltin on this one this is a second rate excessively vicious western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the wild west being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time it would like to be in the tradition of butch cassidy and the sundance kid but lacks that films poignancy and charm andrew mclaglens direction is limp and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes charlton heston and chris mitchum someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire there was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene and the womans reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped theyre like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward michael parks gives one of his typically shifty lethargic mumbling performances but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about'\n 'no one expects the star trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing  this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie cant save this movie  including the goofy scenes with kirk spock and mccoy at yosemitei would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way youll see it  even the cable channels avoid this movie']\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\nc =
